# Movie-Library
A simple movie movie collection, inspired from IMDB &amp; Rotten Tomatoes.
  
  
This project was developed for the "Software Develpment" course at the
department of Computer Science and Engineering in University Of Ioannina. 
  
  
The program uses the data set "hetrec2011-movielens-2k" from grouplens collection  
where you can find online. Check the README.txt file inside the project's files  
to put the data set in correct place. There is no gui for the project you could use  
terminal/cmd to run it! Also i use the free/open source library "itext" under "AGPL license"  
in order to print pdf files and other formats.
